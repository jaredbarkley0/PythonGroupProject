What project are you all doing, and why did you choose it as a project? (Test)

Our project will analyze reading test score data from students at various schools in the Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) to determine if any correlation can be identified between reading test scores and whether or not the student participated in virtual learning during the Fall of 2020. Our analysis will also include other socioeconomic indicators such a whether the child receives free or reduced lunch (FRL), is an English language learner (ELL), or received an individualized education plan (IEP), to see if there is any correlation or interaction between these factors.

Our group is interested in this project as virtual learning is a controversial and emerging trend within education that may outlast the ongoing pandemic.  Hopefully our analysis will help identify whether virtual learning impacts student performance, and whether there is any evidence that it differentially impacts students who are either from lower-income families, are non-native English speakers, or who have behavioral or other individualized learning needs.

What kind of data is it (relates to the above)? Is it from one source, or from multiple sources?

Our data is in a spreadsheet format where each row is a unique student, and we have multiple columns indicating the students test scores during each semester that student has been enrolled in the after school program, as well as whether that student is considered an FRL, ELL or IEP student.  Depending on the number of years that each student has been enrolled in the program, we have quantitative data (test scores) for each semester of enrollment, and categorical data indicating if the student is a member of any of our sub-groups of interest.

What kind of analysis have you done so far (note, analysis here doesn’t mean with Python – often times you have to investigate the data in various ways before you code about it)

**Remember** The largest part of programming is thinking about problems, and how to approach them. That’s what I’m looking for at this checkpoint
