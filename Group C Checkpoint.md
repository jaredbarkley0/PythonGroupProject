**What project are you all doing, and why did you choose it as a project?**

Our project will analyze Covid case counts in Minnesota by county to try to identify factors that may contribute to higher rates of cases.  We will overlay total Covid case counts by county with multiple potential contributing factors, such as population density, number of long-term care facilities in the county, and whether or not the county is part of a major metropolitan area. We will do some basic analysis to determine if relationships are present. If relationships are found, we will also analyze the nature of the relationships.  Are they linear in nature or do they follow a different pattern?

We are interested in looking at data to see if any geospatial factors can be identified that correlate with higher infection rates of Covid.  This may indicate if spread of the virus is linked to specific behaviors in the community, specific types of institutions within the community, or total density of population.

**What kind of data is it (relates to the above)? Is it from one source, or from multiple sources?**

Most of the data we have located is from the Minnesota Department of Health, and is in Excel format. We were interested in analyzing if population density (residents/square mile) had any correlation to number of cases.  One data point we were specifically interested in but haven't yet located in an open source is the population density. This data will be manually added to data obtained from MN Dept of Health.

**What kind of analysis have you done so far (note, analysis here doesn’t mean with Python – often times you have to investigate the data in various ways before you code about it)**

Initial overview of the data confirms that higher population counties have higher total cases of Covid, however additional study is needed to determine if other factors such as number of long term care facilities, population density or metropolitan area designation have a significant impact.
